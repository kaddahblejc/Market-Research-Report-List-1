<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hyperkalemia Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Patiromer</li><li>Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hyperkalemia treatment market is primarily divided into two types: Patiromer and Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate. Patiromer is a potassium-binding polymer that helps lower elevated potassium levels by promoting its excretion through the gastrointestinal tract. Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate, a newer agent, selectively binds potassium in the gut, preventing its absorption. Both products offer effective management options for patients with hyperkalemia, catering to varying clinical needs and preferences, thus driving competition and innovation in hyperkalemia treatment solutions.</p></p>
